![virus](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a6ab4ae-c016-44f2-9a18-ead513527bfa)

## Overview

The "I Love You Virus" is a harmless prank application designed to simulate chaotic behavior on a PC for fun. It creates the illusion of a virus attack by opening multiple Command Prompt (CMD) windows, showing error messages, and causing the PC to shut down. However, this prank app does not cause any real harm to the system or data.

##

<h5>Features</h5>

Simple Yes/No Dialog:
- When the app runs, the user is presented with two options: "Yes" and "No".

Option Behavior:
- If the user selects "Yes":
 -  20-30 Command Prompt windows open.
 -  A shutdown command is initiated, and the system displays a shutdown message before turning off.

If the user selects "No":
- 20-30 Command Prompt windows open.
- A simulated Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) message is shown.
- The system shuts down shortly after.

##

<h5>Harmless Nature:</h5>

- No files are deleted or corrupted.
- The PC behaves normally on the next restart, with no lasting effects.
